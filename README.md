\# WFSL Cross Verify



Deterministic cross-environment verification engine for WFSL systems.



WFSL Cross Verify validates that evidence, proofs, and verification artefacts remain consistent across environments, execution contexts, and deployment boundaries.



All verification outcomes are deterministic and derived solely from declared inputs and WFSL verification standards.



\## Capabilities

\- Cross-environment verification of evidence and proofs

\- Consistency checks across execution contexts

\- Validation of hashes, signatures, and schemas

\- Structured verification outputs for audit and governance

\- Integration with WFSL verification and control-plane systems



\## Scope

WFSL Cross Verify performs verification only.

It does not generate evidence, define policy, or enforce execution.



This component focuses on equivalence and integrity across environments.



\## Intended users

\- WFSL core systems

\- Licensed WFSL services

\- Internal verification, audit, and governance pipelines



This component is not intended for end users or standalone deployment outside the WFSL ecosystem.



\## Licence tier

WFSL-PAID
